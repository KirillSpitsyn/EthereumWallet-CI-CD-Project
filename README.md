`Ethereum Wallet`

`This is a simple implementation of a web Ethereum Wallet that we developed as a group for our final project in the Full Stack II Development Course.
With this wallet, you can import your wallet using private key, add ERC20 tokens and work with different Ethereum networks such as Ethereum,
Polygon, Optimism, Palm, Avalanche C-Chain, Near Protocol, Starknet, and Aurora. Also, with this app, you can transfer Ethereum and ERC20 tokens and see 
balances.` 

`Also, this project was hosted using the CI/CD pipeline. We tested and built our application using GitHub Workflows, then the Docker container was created using Jenkins Pipeline, and the Jenkins server 
was hosted using Ansible node. After that, we deployed our application to Azure Kubernetes Cluster using Terraform and we did final tests using JMeter. Jenkins and Docker files are in this repo.`

`To run the project use:`
